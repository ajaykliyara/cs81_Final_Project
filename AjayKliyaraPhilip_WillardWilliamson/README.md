Project Title
-----------
Lending Club Loan Analysis


Project Abstract
-----------------
Lending Club is a web site where individual borrowers can apply for loans, and individual investors can provide capital for loans.  The purpose of our project was to investigate lendingclub.com historical data with machine learning algorithms.  
Specifically, our project had 3 main goals.  
Our first goal was to develop machine learning models to predict loan default on Lending Club marketplace notes.  The lending club loan marketplace is a note trading platform which allows investors to buy and sell notes from each other.  Notes in the marketplace have gone through the loan origination process and and are fully funded by investors.

Our second goal was to develop machine learning models to make loan origination default predictions.  Loans in the loan origination process are loans which are currently in the funding process and are available for investment by individual investors.

Our third goal was to explore the Lending Club developer application programming interface (API).  Lending Club provides an API which allows investors with sophisticated programming skills to analyze loan data and execute investments via custom software.
